    "##  With thousands of cryptocurrency projects in development, project developers need something to make their projects unique and stand out from the others to attract society adoption and conversation. Dogecoin (a coin with a Shiba Inu as a mascot) would arise as the first of these coins that were meant not to be taken seriously, but were designed more to mock the attraction given to Bitcoin. Oddly, that fringe thought process would later take hold among others in society and Dodgecoin would gain a substantial following allowing it to become an accepted and utilized cryptocurrency. And, as history has demonstrated, \"success breeds imitation‚Äù.\n",

The initial funding source has been kept secret, however, speculation is that Vitalek Buterin, one of the co-developers of the Ethereum blockchain was the source of these funds and that there is a personal connection between Buterin and Ryoshi. This speculation gained further traction when the Shiba Inu coin \"gifted\" Buterin 50% of their minted coins. Buterin would later donate a portion of these coins and \"burn\" the balance, reducing the number of coins in circulation. Buterin would note he was not familiar with the developers of the project and the coins were sent without his permission.[^3]"

The vetting of the coin project prior to listing offers an investor a certain degree to the authenticity of the project.
